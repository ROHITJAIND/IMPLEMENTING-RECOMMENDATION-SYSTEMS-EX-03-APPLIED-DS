# EX-03 Implementing Recommendation Systems
### Aim:
To Implement Recommendation Systems using the suitable data sets.
### Algorithm
STEP 1: Load the necessary Datasets and include the python libraries.<br>
STEP 2: Use Fuzzy library for handling text data and Perform Data Preprocessing steps.<br>
STEP 3: Standardize column names for merging and Apply fuzzy matching to find similar text data between datasets.<br>
STEP 4: Perform Data transformation between datasets and Define a recommendation score using the features of the datasets.<br>
STEP 5: Sort the data by recommendation score and Export the results to a CSV file.
